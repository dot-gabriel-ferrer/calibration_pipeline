# Testing Dataset Analysis Utilities

The unit tests require `numpy`, `astropy`, `pandas`, and `pytest`.

## Running the tests

1. Install the dependencies (if not already available). They are listed in
   `requirements.txt` and can be installed with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Execute the test suite from the repository root:
   ```bash
   pytest -q
   ```
